## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
Step 1
```bash
bash setup.sh
```
Step 2
```bash
conda activate Q2FPhys
```
Step 3
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Testing with Pre-trained Models
Please refer to the configuration files located in `./configs/infer_configs`
For instance, to run the pre-trained model for intra-dataset evaluation on MMPD, execute:
```bash
python main.py --config_file ./configs/infer_configs/MMPD_MMPD_Q2FPhys.yaml
```
